# Privacy Policy — DnD Text RPG

**Last updated:** 14 February 2026

## Overview

DnD Text RPG is a single-player text adventure game. It is designed to operate entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, or share personal data.

## Data Collection

This app does **not** collect or store personal data. The only data retained locally on your device is:

- **API keys** — If you choose to use the optional AI Dungeon Master feature, you may enter an API key for a supported AI provider (Google Gemini, Anthropic, or OpenAI). This key is stored locally on your device using standard app storage and is never transmitted anywhere other than to the AI provider you selected.
- **Hall of Fame entries** — Character names and run statistics are stored locally on your device.
- **Game save data** — Your game progress is stored locally on your device.

No other data is collected, stored, or retained by the app.

## AI Dungeon Master

The AI Dungeon Master is an optional feature. If enabled:

- Text prompts are sent to the AI provider you have configured (Google Gemini, Anthropic, or OpenAI) for processing and a response is returned.
- **No prompts or responses are stored by the app.** They exist only in memory during your session.
- The AI content is filtered to an **age rating of 8+** through system-level prompt constraints.
- Use of third-party AI services is subject to the respective provider's own privacy policy and terms of service.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

This app does **not** share any data with third parties, with the sole exception of prompt requests sent to an AI provider if you have opted to use the AI Dungeon Master feature.

## Analytics and Tracking

This app does **not** include any analytics, tracking, advertising, or telemetry of any kind.

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or any other users.
